# Generative Art

## What you built? 

We built a generative artwork. Every time you refresh the page, a new set of "crystals" appears, each one generated according to a set of rules and some randomness. You can download an instance of the art as an svg.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

Mack:
* Followed the beginner crystal tutorials, which gave an overview of p5js and began the shape generation process.
* Followed the intermediate crystal tutorials where Sud left off, which added svg exporting and began the refactor process.
* Followed the advanced crystal tutorials, which refactored the crystal code from class-based to function-based.
* Edited the crystal code to generate a grid of crystals across the entire page.

Sud:
* Followed the intermediate crystal tutorials, which refactored Macks beginner work into OOP and built on the shape generation process.
* Leveraged examples of flow chart code to create Flow Sketches and TopoMaps.
* Linked up the Topo Map and Flow Sketches so that we can alter between each artwork on one webpage.

Both:
* Picked color schemes :)

## What you learned

We have a huge appreciation for the work of generative artists after this. It took a very long time to generate just rudimentary shapes. Moreover, our works, though random, did not parse a seed as part of that randomness, as most professional generative artists do.

That being said, we learned that p5js is a powerful, easy-to-work-with framework for creating generative art, and that function-based programming is the most robust way to go about writing generative artwork. We were surprised by how little code it took to create beautiful animations.
